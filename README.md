Through pain, through despair, through hate and rage we will come to the goal...
Rest service finally added.

Task was:
1. Build an app to process simple String operations as "ConCut" and "Multiplicate"
2. Wrap it into Rest Service. Spring lib has been chosen
3. Write a Facade DP for Rest Logic
4. Write Unit Tests for logic and operations
5. Write API Tests for Rest Service

Progress:
1. Done
2. Done
3. Done
4. Done
5. Half-done (Launch main)
